# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Case study from the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera


Cyclistic is a successful bike-share offering based out of Chicago, IL. The program has a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the team believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the team believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

Ask: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
